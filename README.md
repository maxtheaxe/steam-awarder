# Steam Awarder
For those who want to give out large numbers of awards, without having to click hundreds of times.

## Technologies
* Python 3.X
* Selenium
* A few more basics

## Installation
_I'm not gonna build executables unless there is demand_
* Clone the repository to a local directory
* Install the dependencies
* [Download appropriate chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home) and place in same directory

## Usage
* Run `awarder.py`
* Optional: load urls from file `--urlfile <filename>`
* Optional: set custom page limit `--pagelimit <new limit>`
* Acknowledge disclaimer
* Log into Steam
* Press Enter in cmd
* Paste reviews URL for target and press Enter (n/a if loading from file)

## Disclaimers & Notes
* Use at your own risk--I'm not responsible if something bad happens
* I rushed this to make sure people could use it right away
* Could _definitely_ be cleaned up, open to pull requests
* Throw a few awards [my way](https://steamcommunity.com/id/JewishJuggernaut/) if you feel like thanking me
* Thanks to [HeyItzWerty](https://steamcommunity.com/id/HeyItzWerty) for help with testing
