# Steam Awarder
For those who want to give out large numbers of awards, without having to click hundreds of times.

## Technologies
* Python 3.X
* Selenium
* win10toast
* A few more basics

## Installation
_I'm not gonna build executables unless there is demand_
* Clone the repository to a local directory
* Install the dependencies
* [Download appropriate chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home) and place in same directory
* Create `account-combos.csv` (username, password)
* Optional: Create `proxy-list.txt` (one proxy per line)
* Optional: Create `proxy-auth.txt` (username \n password)

## Usage
* Run `awarder.py`
* Acknowledge disclaimer
* Log into Steam
* Press Enter in cmd
* Paste reviews URL for target and press Enter

## Disclaimers & Notes
* Use at your own risk--I'm not responsible if something bad happens
* I rushed this to make sure people could use it right away
* Could _definitely_ be cleaned up, open to pull requests
* Throw a few awards [my way](https://steamcommunity.com/id/JewishJuggernaut/) if you feel like thanking me
